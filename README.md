# Star Wars Weekly Scheduler
## Description
A busy Star Wars fan in need of a way to schedule their weekly tasks can do so with this Star Wars themed scheduler. Users of this weekly scheduler can choose which day of the week they need to schedule an item and type in and save their item to a specific time slot. Upon refresh, users will find their information reloads as long as the save button has been clicked. Users can also enjoy a quote from the Star Wars franchise, pulled from multiple movies and televsion shows.
Users can also take a look at the weekday forecast below their scheduler, in case future weather conditions have influence on the items they decide to schedule for that week.

This project is group collaboration to build an app that solves a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests. 

## Technologies Used
This scheduler uses GitHub, VS Code, Terminal, Bash, Bulma, OpenWeather API, and Swagger Star Wars Quote API.
